# Livy-Frontend-Assessment
 This App was developed for specially for Livy's Frontend Code             Assessment

The App was made responsive so it's confortable to use it either from phones, tablets and computers (the last being the most from my standpoint)

The main idea is to check all the Gnomes that live in Brastlewark.
You can search by name or id, and also have the possibility to filter by profession, age, weight and height.

You can click on any name and you'll see all the information available for that specific Gnome.

Thank you very much for the opportunity!
